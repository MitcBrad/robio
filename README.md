# robio
This was a project website made as a "wiki" for a game that I helped develop and program - in lua - for on ROBLOX.
This was initially ran utilizing XAMPP's suite w/ Apache, SQL, etc.

The database was stored on PHPMyAdmin. The site initially was hosted on 000webhost, but is no longer active.

Prepros was initially used to convert the SCSS to the CSS for ease of access. 
The PHP webpages honestly should be organized in their own directory but I can't be bothered to go back and 
correct that right now as there's FAR more to go back and correct than just file structure. I'd also have to update
referencing for CSS, JS, etc. in all of the files if I went back and did that so nty.

Anyways yeah I made this in around 2019, during I believe the second semester of my freshman year. IIRC it was around
10,000 lines of code altogether if you cheat and count the CSS as well as the SCSS. Otherwise it's like 8,800 or something.
Still pretty neat.
